# Sound Files Placeholder

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `key-press.mp3` - Sound when typing a correct character
- `word-complete.mp3` - Sound when completing a word
- `game-over.mp3` - Sound when game ends
- `level-up.mp3` - Sound when advancing to next level
- `background-music.mp3` - Background music for gameplay

For development, you can:
1. Use free sound effects from websites like freesound.org or zapsplat.com
2. Generate simple sounds using online tools
3. Use text-to-speech for temporary placeholders

The game will work without sound files, but will show warnings in the console.
